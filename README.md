## General Info
This project is called "Cheese Game", this game is also more widely known as "Dots and Boxes".
The game is a two-player game and the goal is to 'create' as many boxes as possible.
You start by 'drawing' a line, here by clicking a button. Then the next player follows.
You create a box by clicking four surrounding buttons, which therefore creates a square.
You can block the opponent from creating a box by adding a line close to theirs. 
In the end you win by having the most amount of boxes.

## Goals

This is a game created by three IMS students; Ian Liu, Valentina Mettler Moreira and Sara Cabrera Ramirez.
Our goal is to code a functioning and user-friendly object-orientated game.
