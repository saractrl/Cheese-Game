## General Info
This project is called "Cheese Game", this game is also more widely known as "Dots and Boxes".
The game is a two-player game and the goal is to 'create' as many boxes as possible.
You start by 'drawing' a line, here by clicking a button. Then the next player follows.
You create a box by clicking four surrounding buttons, which therefore creates a square.
