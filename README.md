## General info

This project is called "Cheese Game", this game is also more widely known as "Dots and Boxes".
The game is a two-player game, and the goal is to 'create' as many boxes as possible.
You start by 'drawing' a line, here by clicking a button. Then the next player follows.
You create a box by clicking four surrounding buttons, which therefore creates a square.
You can block the opposing player from creating a box.


## Goals

This is a game created by three second-year IMS students; Ian Liu, Valentina Mettler Moreira and Sara Cabrera Ramirez.
Our goal is to code a functioning and userfriendly object-orientated game.


## Technologies.

* WPF
* C#
* HTML
* CSS
* JS

## Setup

The code was written in C# on Visual Studio using WPF and XAML. XAML (WPF) was used for the Graphic User Interface. Our idea was to create an object-oriented game. The implementation of an object-oriented game was quite hard due to the limitations of WPF. Some features we were able to do with object-oriented programming but to be able to use the game how we wanted to we had to sadly ditch that part. Our goal also was to fill out a box every time you create one be able to start a new game, have a help button and count the number of boxes filled. We're very satisfied to say that despite not having an object-oriented game we managed to reach those goals mentioned.
In the future we could add the feature that allows you to play against a computer. At the moment it's just a two-player game.


The website was created with CSS and HTML. You can access it by clicking "HELP" in our game or via this link: https://saractrl.github.io/Cheese-Game/ .
