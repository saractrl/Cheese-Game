            The Cheesegame, also known as Dots and Boxes, is a game which is played by two players. 
            It begins with an empty grid of dots. Players must take turns 
            in connecting the dots to form a box, with a horizontal or a vertical 
            line between two unconnected dots. The player who completes a 1 x 1 box 
            receives a point and takes another turn. Once a player has completed a 
            box, a cross will appear inside the completed box with the color the player 
            used to draw the lines. The game finishes when there are no more lines to be 
            set and the player with the most points wins.
